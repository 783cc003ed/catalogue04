What are artifacts?   ...   <br>The lessons learned during this phase can improve the organization’s incident security protocols and make its security strategy more robust and effective.”   ...   <br>During the second incident response step, Detection and Analysis, incident response tools provide capabilities for deep technical investigation.   ...   <br>Artifacts are invaluable to a red team operator as they provide critical insights into how defenders detect and respond to malicious activities.   ...   <br>What are artifacts?   ...   <br>These artifacts can be broadly categorized into several types based on their purpose and the phase of the incident response process in which they are used.   ...   <br>This blog post as well as the developed tool will focus on artifacts that can be collected during the active user session from the registry and file system with regular user privileges.   ...   <br>The following table provides an overview of what information the developed tool collects and what we as red team operators can learn from the collected information.   ...   <br>Explorer files and folders	What are recently accessed files and their locations?   ...   <br>As a red team operator I spend a lot of my time in the C2 framework executing tools and collection information.   ...   <br>The developed tool KNOCKOUT can be executed after compilation by using either the binary as a standalone executable, or by using your favorite C2 framework and its built-in C# execution command.   ...   <br>A screenshot of the tool being executed using in-process C# using the command “sharpinline” of the C2 framework Brute Ratel C4:   ...   <br>The tool can also be executed as a standalone binary:   ...   <br>In the beginning of the tool development a decision had to be made to access the registry on the live system as access to the underlying file of the user hive “NTUSER.DAT” was not possible as a low privileged user as the file is in use.   ...   <br>With higher privileges there are ways to access this file and exfiltrate it to query the data on a local system and evade the endpoint protection.   ...   <br>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RecentDocs	Registry	Retrieve information about the recent files and folders accessed by the user.   ...   <br>The following Windows API calls are being used by the tool:   ...   <br>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winreg/nf-winreg-regenumvaluea RegQueryValueEx	advapi32.dll	Retrieves the type and data for the specified value name associated with an open registry key.   ...

<blockquote>
Our investigation uncovered the use of additional tools, including Ngrok for proxy services, SystemBC, and two well-known command and control frameworks: Sliver and PoshC2.   ...   <br>Summary Analysts Adversary Infrastructure Capability Victim Indicators Summary   ...   <br>Their toolkit featured scripts such as atera_del.bat and atera_del2.bat to remove Atera agents, backup.bat and delbackup.bat to delete system backups and shadow copies, and clearlog.bat to erase Windows event logs and associated data.   ...   <br>The actor employed cmd.cmd to disable User Account Control and modify registry settings, while scripts like def1.bat and defendermalwar.bat are used to disable Windows Defender, scheduled tasks, and uninstall Malwarebytes.   ...   <br>The script also included instructions to download the .MSI version of the Atera Agent using curl and a login of ‘datilragna@gmail.com’, which appears to be a legitimate email address associated with an Atera Agent account.   ...   <br>During our analysis of the IP address hosting the open directory, 94.198.53.143, we found it associated with PoshC2.   ...   <br>However, the most interesting part of the March version of the open directory was the ‘poschc2+user.txt’ file, which we managed to retrieve before it was deleted by the threat actor.   ...   <br>The DFIR Report threat intelligence team has been monitoring these IP addresses for their involvement in various command and control frameworks for our Threat Feeds, prior to our investigation into the open directory.   ...   <br>This batch script is for removing Atera remote management agent.   ...   <br>This batch script deletes various Hyper-V, SQL, and Firebird server services.   ...   <br>This batch script contains a Ngrok authentication token that runs on port 3389 (RDP).   ...   <br>This batch script that contains a Ngrok authentication token that runs in the same port, 3389 (RDP).   ...   <br>SystemBC malware executable.   ...   <br>This batch script is to remove services and processes associated with Hyper-V, multiple AV programs, SQL, and other specific services.   ...   <br>The main goal of this batch file is to remove and uninstall Atera software, including the registry keys, services, and directories associated with Atera Agent installation.   ...   <br>The taskkill command is used to terminate a specific process, which in this case is the TicketingTray.exe.   ...   <br>TicketingTray.exe is part of the AteraAgent software commonly used to display the Atera Icon on the system.   ...   <br>In this case, it uses the “/All’ parameter which deletes all shadow copies on the system.   ...   <br>This command has a loop that iterates through the output of wevtutil.exe el command, which lists event logs and, for each line, calls the :do_clear subroutine with the line’s content as an argument.   ...   <br>During our usual analysis, these are the artifacts that are commonly left by the threat actor for us to identify the RDP related activities as part of their lateral movement.   ...   <br>These commands attempt to delete registry keys related to remote desktop settings under the current user’s profile, where the following options were used: /va: Deletes all values associated with the key /f: Forces the deletion, even if the key is protected   ...   <br>The following batch script is another defense evasion script that provides several commands to disable Windows Defender.   ...   <br>This batch script executes several commands designed to disable various Windows Defender registry keys and alter User Account Control settings.   ...   <br>WMIC command was also used in the last part of the script to uninstall Malwarebytes.   ...   <br>The commands above were used to modify the registry key settings related to UAC on a Windows system.   ...   <br>These PowerShell commands remove the Windows Defender feature, forcefully restart the Windows Defender service, and forcefully restart the Windows Firewall service.   ...   <br>The last part of the script automates the deletion of all shadow copies (backup snapshots) on a Windows system and then removes itself.   ...   <br>First, it changes the directory to the one containing the script, then, creates and executes a command sequence through diskshadow, to delete the shadow copies; and finally, deletes the command file and the script itself, after pausing for user input.   ...   <br>This batch script contains 398 lines of code and can kill processes and disable multiple services including web servers, databases, and exchange services.   ...   <br>The script also deletes many AV services, including Trend Micro, ESET, and Kaspersky:   ...   <br>Its noteworthy that the threat actor mistyped Delete (Delite) multiple times in the script comments, this could indicate that English may be a second language for this threat actor.   ...   <br>An additional capability of this script, its disabling and deleting of Volume Shadow Copies (vssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet), suggests that it is meant to be used during ransomware attacks, to accelerate the encryption and prevent the victim from recovering the files.   ...   <br>The script also deletes two services related to FireBird:   ...   <br>This script is one of the shortest scripts in the threat actor’s toolkit.   ...   <br>This script is similar to the first ngrok script NG1.bat.   ...   <br>Aside from starting multiple services using net start command, below are the configuration changes using sc command   ...   <br>native_dropper is the Linux version of Posh_v2_dropper_x64.exe, which is the Windows version of it.   ...   <br>The below commands are used to create a user account “WDAGUtilltyAccount” with a password of “Ujmqaz5055”.   ...   <br>The first one is registry modification, which is used to enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on a Windows machine by setting the value of “fDenyTSConnections” to “0”.   ...   <br>This script is a configured version of https://github.com/nettitude/PoshC2/blob/master/resources/payload-templates/dropper.py .   ...   <br>These commands are used to check if specific antivirus or endpoint security services are running on a Windows system.   ...   <br>Second part of the script is to stop multiple services related to MS SQL, as well as disable the related services via “sc config” command.   ...   <br>These commands delete registry entries for various antivirus and security services from the Windows Registry.   ...

<blockquote>
To wrap up this blog series we wanted to include one more technique that you can use when exploiting this class of vulnerabilities.   ...   <br>This technique, introduced to us by Abdelhamid Naceri, becomes useful when you have an on-boot arbitrary delete primitive that you want to transform into an on-demand delete, so that you can escalate using the C:\Config.msi technique.   ...   <br>We will also share a tool that can make debugging protected processes on Windows easier and end by detailing some difficulties we faced during disclosures with several vendors.   ...

Краткое содержание: 

<blockquote>
We plan on these being annual awards, with the categories changing to keep with the latest changes in the threat landscape – or if there’s someone or something we really want to highlight.   ...   <br>While it certainly may be fun to point out errors that occur, we think it’s more important to highlight the good work being done that would otherwise go unnoticed.   ...   <br>This award goes to the individual (or team) who had the best use of the enclosure in this year’s events.   ...   <br>We are happy to continue to work with this researcher and anticipate more great research from them in the future.   ...   <br>Some are more esoteric while others are straightforward and likely to be exploited.   ...   <br>Some of his reports have also been used as guest blogs for the ZDI, with little changes or editing needed.   ...   <br>Security advisories are one of the best tools in the defender’s arsenal to gauge the risk to their enterprise, but not all advisories provide accurate, thorough information.   ...   <br>They also highlight the work of the many researchers reporting bugs to them with their acknowledgments.   ...   <br>That’s why it is important to highlight the vendors who are honest and transparent with their communications, even if they are communicating bad news.   ...   <br>They were also instrumental in helping the first-ever Pwn2Own Automotive be such a success.   ...   <br>Ivanti had a rough start to 2024, but CEO Jeff Abbott set out to, “look critically at every phase of our processes, and every product, to ensure the highest level of protection for our customers.” Here at the ZDI, we’ve seen this improvement firsthand as we continue to report vulnerabilities to them.   ...   <br>When dealing with as many disclosures as we do, it’s good to recognize those vendors who take bug reports seriously and patch them as fast as possible.   ...
