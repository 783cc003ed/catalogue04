<blockquote>
What about cryptography?   ...   <br>Now, I know it’s a job fair and these kinds of questions are expected, but in contrast to other more straightforward career paths such as software engineering or machine-learning, I have the feeling that getting into the offensive side of cybersecurity is still a mystery.   ...   <br>People often asked whether knowing how to code is essential for a position as a hacker, and what would be the best programming language to start with.   ...   <br>Having said that, it is important to understand code and be able to play with it.   ...   <br>Networking is one of the core concepts not only of computer science in general, but also of cybersecurity.   ...   <br>Answer questions like: How does the internet work?   ...   <br>So, try to get a clear perspective on all these protocols; how they work, and what key role do they play.   ...   <br>If you also feel like having a practical perspective on the networking side, try scanning your home network (or networks you explicitly got the permission to scan) with nmap, play around with the dig command to learn more about a particular domain, try to contact another computer using ping, or use Wireshark to analyze the traffic in your network.   ...   <br>The two cryptography types, asymmetric and symmetric cryptography, play an essential role in the security of communications and data.   ...   <br>What is the purpose of TLS, and how does it play a role in web traffic?   ...   <br>However, even though browsing through a page is familiar, the concepts and inner workings of web applications may not be.   ...   <br>It is important for an applicant to properly understand and be able to explain the concepts of frontend and backend, what is an HTTP request and of which parts it’s composed, which types of HTTP requests exist, what is authentication, what is authorization, how is the session handled in a web application.   ...   <br>Although the theory behind these attacks can be learnt by heart, it is important to get your hands dirty and practice them against different targets and in different scenarios.   ...   <br>If you reach this point, you’ll probably notice that you’ll need some tools to help you on your path; say hello to the interception proxy.   ...   <br>Do I have to have a degree in computer science to work in cybersecurity?   ...   <br>If you’re not, then don’t worry, there’s plenty of resources to gain the knowledge and learn the abilities that are required for this job without having to play CTFs.   ...

Краткое содержание: 

<blockquote>
I decided to try and focus on the binary exploitation challenges.   ...   <br>This is a type of vulnerability where submitted data of an input string is evaluated as an argument to an unsafe use of e.g., a printf() function by the application, resulting in the ability to read and/or write to memory.   ...   <br>This is actually provided by the vulnerable binary itself via a puts() function to simulate an information leak printed to stdout, Dynamically calculate the base address of the libc library, Overwrite the puts function address in the Global Offset Table (GOT) with the system function address using a format string vulnerability.   ...   <br>The binary provides us with the memory address of the setvbuf function in the libc library, We have a way of providing a string as input which is read by the fgets function and printed back in an unsafe manner using printf, The program finishes with a puts() function call that writes /bin/sh to stdout.   ...   <br>Read arbitrary stack values, using format specifiers such as %x (hexadecimal) or %p (pointers), Read from arbitrary memory addresses using a combination of %c to move the argument pointer and %s to print the contents of memory starting from an address we specify in our input string, Write to arbitrary memory addresses by controlling the output counter using %mc, which will increase the output counter with m. Then, we can write the output counter value to memory using %n, again if we provide the memory address correctly as part of our input string.   ...   <br>Even though the source code already indicates that our input is unsafely processed and parsed as an argument for the printf() function, we can verify that we have a format string vulnerability here by providing %p as input, which should read a value as a pointer and print it back to us:   ...   <br>The challenge preceding format string 3, called format string 2, actually provided very good practice to get to know format string specifiers and how you can abuse them to read from memory and write to memory.   ...   <br>We are now armed with an information leak that provides us a memory address and a format string vulnerability.   ...   <br>Before we can really start, there is something we need to address: how do we know where our input string is located in memory once we have sent it to the program?   ...   <br>This provides 8 A characters, and then a format specifier to read the 2nd argument to the printf() function, which will, in this case, be a value from memory:   ...   <br># Continue the program since it will hit the breakpoint # on the first puts call in our program (Howdy Gamers !)   ...   <br>Our input string now tries to write the value of the output counter to the memory address we were pointing to before with %p, which is… our input string itself.   ...   <br>To clearly grasp the concept: if we change our input string to BBBBBBBB, we will now write to 0x4242424242424242 instead, indicating we can control to which memory address we are writing something by modifying our input string.   ...   <br>Fetch the address of our setvbuf function in the libc library, provided by the program, From this address, calculate the base address of libc, Send a format string payload that overwrites the puts function address in the GOT with the system function address in libc, Continue execution to give control to the operator.   ...   <br>We do this by subtracting the setvbuf function address from our manually loaded libc from our leaked function address:   ...   <br>What: the system function address in libc Where: the puts entry in the GOT of our binary   ...   <br>the system function address in libc (0x7f852ddca760) the puts entry in the GOT of our binary (0x404018)   ...   <br>This:   ...   <br>Now that we understand the payload, we load the binary using ELF and send our payload to our target process, after which we give interactive control to the operator:   ...   <br>The preceding challenges that lead up to this challenge (format string 0, 1, 2) proved to be a great help in understanding format string vulnerabilities and how to exploit them.   ...

# Targeting an industrial protocol gateway

Краткое содержание: 

<blockquote>
Among them, you may have heard of Modbus, maybe S7comm, OPC-UA and a few others, but do you know all the industrial protocols you could find on industrial networks?   ...   <br>In light of that, I wanted to assess the security of a gateway model that I often encounter during penetration tests on OT: the Anybus X-Gateway from HMS networks.   ...   <br>Therefore, it is supposed to be connected to an IP network in an industrial system so that it can be configured and do what is needed: establish a link between devices that don’t speak the same language.   ...   <br>This could happen, for instance, if the attacker is located on the OT network with direct access to the gateway or has managed to reach it from the IT network or from the Internet.   ...   <br>We can see a few regular IT administration services on TCP: FTP, Telnet and HTTP.   ...   <br>I used all of them but is there anything left to say about their security?   ...   <br>The associated protocols have weaknesses on their own as well, but this exceeds the scope of this article: Port 502/tcp is for Modbus TCP, which is widely used in OT and supported by the gateway; Ports 44818/tcp, 44818/udp and 2222/udp are for Ethernet/IP, this is our entry point for protocol translation.   ...   <br>I have not spent much time on this one yet but 44818/udp is uncommon, it could as well be something else and requires further investigation; Port 3250/udp is used by the protocol HICP, which is the proprietary protocol used by HMS devices for IP network discovery and configuration.   ...   <br>As for port 7412, I tried all four ways: the service never responded to my requests, this port does not seem to be the standard port for any service, the documentation does not say a word about it and the technical support from HMS Networks told me that it had no idea either (really?   ...   <br>Ultimately, there was no need to know what it was to make the device crash.   ...   <br>According to HMS networks, the bug comes from the physical components of the gateway, which means that there can be no patch to fix this vulnerability, the only solution is to replace the device.   ...   <br>We can try to misuse other services, where the word “misuse” can have two meanings: either we make the device do what it is not supposed to do, or we make it do what it is supposed to do, but not in the intended way.   ...   <br>The gateway exposes the service HTTP to provide a web interface for network configuration and network diagnostics.   ...   <br>To do this, we just send valid HICP requests to the device.   ...   <br>We can now use it to write a script that can change the configuration, and even set a password if we want.   ...   <br>And of course, the authentication on HICP can be bypassed as the web interface also provides a feature to change the network settings, which remains unauthenticated, even when a password is set using HICP.   ...   <br>However, the device does not provide an easy way to disable any of the services and HMS Networks’ support confirmed that they can’t be disabled.   ...   <br>Measures taken by HMS Networks   ...   <br>Here is what they decided as a countermeasure: As there is a newer version of this Anybus device (ABC4014-A), the vulnerabilities for this model will not be patched.   ...   <br>Denial of service on port 7412: The new version uses a completely different hardware and firmware and does not implement the same services on port 7412, therefore the attack is not supposed to work; Reboot feature on web service: This unauthenticated URL endpoint is apparently not exposed, I have been told that the web service is the only service that can be disabled in this new version; HICP protocol: The new version only supports SHICP, not HICP;   ...   <br>One of the CVE causes crashes, another allows a very simple Denial of Service attack, and two of them can be used to legitimately change the configuration anonymously, which is already enough; They do not require a high level of knowledge to make use of them; They are very easy to uncover, by anyone, as they are all based on the regular usage of legitimate features.   ...   <br>2023-09-25: Vulnerability reports sent to HMS Networks.   ...
