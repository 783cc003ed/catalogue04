Краткое содержание: 

<blockquote>
OpenID Connect and OAuth2 are two authentication frameworks that have become popular in recent years.   ...   <br>When a user attempts to log in to a Web application, the Web server verifies the user’s credentials and returns a JWT containing all relevant data: the user’s identity and authorization details.   ...   <br>A JWT consists of three parts: The Header, Payload and Signature also known as JSON Web Signature (JWS).   ...   <br>The header segment of a JWT contains information about the signing algorithm and token type.   ...   <br>For asymmetric signing algorithms using RSA (e.g. RS256), the JWT signatures are generated using a private key and the server can validate them using the public key.   ...   <br>All arbitrary signatures are accepted and the server trusts all forged JWTs.   ...   <br>Some misconfigured servers will use the this public key embedded in the JWT to verify the signature instead of using their own set of whitelisted public keys.   ...   <br>We are seeing more and more web applications using JWTs for authentication and authorization.   ...   <br>However, if you have a somewhat special case and you have different JWTs contained in a request, the extension allows you to simply select the JWT that you want to test and run the extension on it.   ...   <br>More info about this training in general can be found here: https://www.compass-security.com/en/trainings/web-application-security-advanced.   ...

Краткое содержание: 

<blockquote>
First, all the data of interest is uploaded to a file transfer services such as Dropbox or Mega, or to a TA-owned infrastructure.   ...   <br>Some TAs list their victims on darknet leak sites and threaten to leak stolen data, including the PII they have stolen.   ...   <br>There have even been reports of the TA moving on and reporting the breach to the authorities!   ...   <br>The second best option (the best, of course, is never to be in this situation in the first place) is to restore from backups and identify the data that was lost.   ...   <br>Key details to determine include how and when the TA accessed the systems, how they escalated privileges, what data was stolen, and whether there are any surprises left in the form of backdoors.   ...   <br>First of all, recovery with a decryptor might not be faster at all, and there’s no guarantee that the data won’t be leaked.   ...   <br>How to not become a victim in the first place?   ...   <br>Ransomware groups are in it for the money (or in the words of Lockbit3: “We want nothing more than money”).   ...   <br>Have immutable or detached backups that cannot be encrypted in the event of a complete environment compromise Test the restore to ensure that all required information and configuration is included in the backups Have 2FA enabled for at least all external accounts Have an emergency patching process in place, especially for externally exposed systems Install an endpoint protection solution on all endpoints and monitor the alerts it generates Have network segmentation in place and enforce it with no exceptions Check your Active Directory for misconfigurations that allow privilege escalation   ...   <br>Note: This training will be held in German only (slides/course material are in English).   ...

<blockquote>
In this case, we observed a threat actor deliver IcedID using this method.   ...   <br>The threat actor used Cobalt Strike and AnyDesk to target a file server and a backup server.   ...   <br>For example, the Cobalt Strike server in this case was detected weeks before this intrusion started.   ...   <br>Table of Contents: Case Summary Analysts Initial Access Execution Persistence Privilege Escalation Defense Evasion Credential Access Discovery Lateral Movement Collection Command and Control Exfiltration Impact Timeline Diamond Model Indicators Detections   ...   <br>On day 33 of the intrusion, the IcedID malware launched several Cobalt Strike beacons.   ...   <br>On the backup server, they used Internet Explorer to download a Cobalt Strike beacon and then they executed it.   ...   <br>Utilizing the FileZilla client, they established a SFTP connection to a remote server, initiating the data exfiltration process.   ...   <br>Following the execution of ransomware on the file server, the threat actor re-established their connection to the backup server, conducting similar checks via Task Manager and Local Group Policy Manager before dropping the ransomware file.   ...   <br>After using this tool, they followed the same batch script execution on this server as previously observed.   ...   <br>After execution, they dropped and ran ProcessHacker and then proceeded to open the batch file in notepad++ before re-running the script and ransomware.   ...   <br>Approximately two hours after the initiation of the ransomware on the file server, the threat actor revisited the system through their AnyDesk connection.   ...   <br>The campaign ID used by threat actor was 3329953471, embedded in the configuration data in the IcedID DLL payload.   ...   <br>After clicking through the warning prompt, the O p e n.cmd file executed PowerShell to download an IcedID DLL named as if it was a JPG file, then used rundll32 to execute the DLL, which immediately connected to command and control servers, checked in and started beaconing over unencrypted HTTP, triggering an Emerging Threats Open rule: ET MALWARE Win32/IcedID Request Cookie.   ...   <br>On the 33rd day of the intrusion, the IcedID malware was observed dropping several files.   ...   <br>These files were Cobalt Strike beacons, which were then executed via the IcedID malware.   ...   <br>IcedID was running in rundll32.exe, which launched a DLL version of Cobalt Strike beacon from the user’s AppData\Local\Temp directory using regsvr32.exe.   ...   <br>During lateral movement activity, the threat actors deployed the same executable Cobalt Strike beacon as seen on the beachhead host.   ...   <br>During the initial execution of IcedID, the following two files were created under the AppData Roaming folder of the user that executed it:   ...   <br>It is unusual for rundll32 to be executed without any command line, but it is a common pattern for Cobalt Strike beacon injection target processes.   ...   <br>The rundll32 process also created a named pipe (Sysmon Event ID 17) with a pipe name that started with “\postex_” which is another well-known Cobalt Strike beacon artifact that can be detected.   ...   <br>IcedID was observed executing multiple discovery commands originating from rundll32.exe on the beachhead.   ...   <br>RDP was used by the threat actors to move laterally from the beachhead to other servers in the environment.   ...   <br>After connecting to each server with RDP, the threat actors took steps to deploy a Cobalt Strike beacon, as well as AnyDesk on the system.   ...   <br>A concrete example is, directly after the threat actors accesses the file server with AnyDesk, they use notepad++ to open a file related to the insurance policy of this victim.   ...   <br>IcedID Cobalt Strike AnyDesk   ...   <br>IcedID   ...   <br>The IcedID DLL running in the rundll32 process immediately connected to its command and control server on port 80, using domain name aerilaponawki[.   ...   <br>The IcedID process also connected to two other command and control servers by domain name, but both of these connections used TLS over port 443, so it was not possible for the network sensor to observe as much content or match as many network detection rules as it would have with TLS termination or unencrypted traffic.   ...   <br>For each of the domains, an overview of the relevant rules that can be used (in combination) to look for IcedID behavior:   ...   <br>It appears to be a different IP for one of the previously found command and control domains.   ...   <br>The Cobalt Strike beacons which were used during the intrusion were named:   ...   <br>The command and control server appears to have been in use through at least April 2024 with a different Cobalt Strike beacon reported to the Triage malware sandboxing service using the same gmail-like profile and remote IP as observed in this intrusion.   ...   <br>Shortly after, we find the first connection to the server using the malleable profile paths:   ...   <br>During later stages of the intrusion, the threat actors deployed AnyDesk using a PowerShell script copied under C:\ProgramData\INSTALL.ps1.   ...   <br>In addition, the copied PowerShell script was executed on multiple systems to facilitate the deployment of AnyDesk using the following commands:   ...   <br>After the threat actors gained access to a file server in the domain, they quickly prepared this machine for exfiltration.   ...   <br>Shortly after, the threat actors connected from the file server, using FileZilla, to 45.155.204.5 via SSH and key exchange can be observed in the network traffic:   ...   <br>The ransomware files, in this case svchost.exe and an ‘automation’ file [REDACTED].1.bat, were delivered via the AnyDesk sessions as parent process.   ...   <br>After the execution on the file server, the threat actors moved to the backup server, where they repeated their interest in the Group Policy.   ...   <br>This is based on the fact that, the threat actors executed the ransomware binary 11 times on the backup server and afterwards returned and executed the ransomware a second time on the file server.   ...   <br>Credentials In Files - T1552.001 Data Encrypted for Impact - T1486 Data from Network Shared Drive - T1039 Domain Groups - T1069.002 Domain

Краткое содержание: 

<blockquote>
These words describe techniques that can be used on Windows servers to connect to resources and obtain information about a computer or Active Directory objects such as users or SMB shares you have access on.   ...   <br>One could say that if you don’t have any credentials you cannot authenticate to the SMB service and thus cannot list available shares but that’s not true if the guest account of the domain is enabled.   ...   <br>Now that we have disabled both the domain guest account and the local guest accounts, can we consider that we are safe ?   ...   <br>This is the reason why we can launch the following commands and get results from a null session authentication:   ...   <br>But interestingly enough, if we take a look at the members of the “Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access” on WINTERFELL we will see that it doesn’t contain the “Anonymous Logon” group:   ...   <br>Disable all guest accounts whether it is the domain guest account or the local guest accounts Check the permissions of the “Anonymous Logon” group on your domain and restrict them as much as you can   ...
