# Punch Card Hacking – Exploring a Mainframe Attack Vector

Краткое содержание: 

<blockquote>
A look at Jobs, JES, and JCL   ...   <br>Before diving into how we can abuse some of these services we will look at a core concept of the z/OS that, somewhat surprisingly, derives directly from job cards like the one pictured here:   ...   <br>Most of the work carried out by a mainframe is performed through the use of jobs.   ...   <br>A job is a unit of work, consisting of one or more steps that are executed to perform a task.   ...   <br>Lines of JCL begin with the double slash “//” A comma is used at the end of a line to continue a JCL statement on a new line.   ...   <br>We assume that our FTP user is called NVISO, we are working locally from a Linux machine, and create our job, much like the example above and save it to our local machine:   ...   <br>We now use the “site” subcommand to change into JES mode, followed by the “put” command which in JES mode will submit our job.   ...   <br>The output indicates that we were able to transfer our JCL to JES and it is now in the job queue with the ID JOB00093.   ...   <br>The output RC=0000 (return code zero) indicates that our job completed successfully, meaning our user is able to submit jobs, our JCL syntax is appropriate, and our user can allocate datasets.   ...   <br>Depending on the configuration of the FTP server we may be able to review the output of our jobs.   ...   <br>The important configuration item in this case is a JESINTERFACELEVEL of 2, without this we are likely only to see the return code of the job and none of the details.   ...   <br>The list command for this job ID will look something like this:   ...   <br>When jobs are submitted to JES the validity of the JCL is checked before the job is scheduled for execution.   ...   <br>This would allow jobs to be submitted as that user and executed with that user’s permissions.   ...   <br>Using the common programs in the list above we can run TSO and UNIX commands, create and copy files, and execute REXX scripts.   ...

# The End of Passwords? Embrace the Future with Passkeys.

Краткое содержание: 

<blockquote>
This is amazing, as Passkeys is the game-changer for cyber security because it could imply the solution to one of the biggest headaches in cyber security: password use.   ...   <br>The universal use of authentication to access a wide array of personal or business applications has created a situation where, to stay secure, a password manager and multi-factor authentication (MFA) are indispensable for critical services.   ...   <br>Passphrases, like passwords, are secrets you need to remember and enter manually.   ...   <br>A Private Key: Securely stored on the user’s device.   ...   <br>The private key is the crucial element to secure, often stored in a password vault or, even better, in the TPM chip of your computer.   ...   <br>Security keys like YubiKey are also based on those standards.   ...   <br>For companies, the cost of buying and managing large numbers of physical keys was also a barrier.   ...   <br>The good thing is that you have plenty of options!   ...   <br>The not so good thing is that they all have their pros and cons.   ...   <br>Store your passkeys in:	PROS	CONS TPM chip of your computer	High security, protection against hardware and software attacks with the integrated TPM Chip	Less flexible for multi-device access Smartphone	Convenient and mobile, dedicated security modules (Apple Secure Enclave or Android Trust Zone)	Issues if lost or stolen without backups IAM (Identity and Access Management) Solutions (Google Cloud IAM, Azure AD, AWS IAM)	Centralized management, advanced security, multi-factor support	Complex setup and management, dependency on cloud services Password Managers (1Password, Dashlane, Bitwarden, … )	Flexibility, multi-device access, robust encryption	Depends on the security of the manager, risk of compromise Hardware Security Keys (YubiKey, Google Titan)	Maximum security, portable, compatible with many services	Need to carry the key, risk of loss or theft Alternatives to store your passkeys   ...   <br>I do not use YubiKeys yet, but they are the best option to store my passkeys.   ...   <br>Users will realize that passkeys simplify their lives, and companies and users alike will appreciate the reduced risk of breaches from phishing or brute-force attacks.   ...   <br>Although current passkeys do not yet utilize quantum-resistant cryptography, they offer a flexible and scalable solution.   ...

# Hunting for Remote Management Tools

https://blog.nviso.eu/2024/07/18/hunting-for-remote-management-tools/

Краткое содержание: 

<blockquote>
This blog post aims to share our insights from numerous threat hunts focused on RMM tools as well as various incident response engagements in which we observed threat actors installing these RMM tools for prolonged access into environments, and offer recommendations on how organizations can mitigate associated risks.   ...   <br>However, it is important to look for outlier and verify—if there are only a few systems using another or multiple RMMs, that could be a sign of malicious activity.   ...   <br>In general, we see that organizations have made a big push forward in terms of their cybersecurity efforts, this means that attackers need to become more creative in finding ways around the installed security products and implemented controls (such as in most case, an EDR tool).   ...   <br>Limit the usage and amount of allowed RMM tools within your environment Scan your environment for the presence of RMM tools on a recurring basis Ensure visibility and auditability on the usage of RMM tools Following an incident, ensure that only known and trusted RMM tools are present within your environment   ...   <br>Attackers can install RMM software on the systems themselves to retain persistence in the environment for an extended period, which we have observed several times in our incident response engagements.   ...   <br>Legitimate use and logging: It should be validated if the identified RMM tools are expected within the environment.   ...

# make prs, not war

Краткое содержание: 

<blockquote>
The choice to give, or to take, is something that I believe is deeply rooted in each of us, and choosing to give, to contribute no matter how big or small, almost always ends up bigger than ourselves.   ...   <br>I want to tell you a little about the idea and symbolism if you’ll indulge me.   ...   <br>And that is what this year’s art is too.   ...   <br>There are many reasons not to contribute, and that will always be the easiest way out.   ...   <br>It builds us as people, as an industry and ultimately as society.   ...   <br>Regardless of this, a re-imagination of the phrase as “Make PR’s, not War” is symbolism of the message that we should be contributing (via Pull Requests as a metaphor for contributions), while also living in a time where there are violent conflicts going on in North Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe.   ...   <br>As a core part of being human, together with the idea that contributions can have a profound impact on other humans around us, the image should ideally be centred around a heart.   ...   <br>The use of a heart serves as a reminder that the best way for you to discover where and what you can contribute is to search deep within yourself (your heart).   ...   <br>A “good” (make PRs) part, and a bad (not war) part.   ...   <br>The good side should symbolise a world where we all contribute, how we flourish not only as an industry, but as humanity as a whole.   ...   <br>The intention here is to symbolise that we each have this choice to make, both from an early age, but also daily in which side we’re going to operate in.   ...   <br>Realise that we might be in the technology industry, but consider that contributions come in many ways, and span far beyond writing code.   ...   <br>I hope you enjoy this art as much as I did the process of making it come to life.   ...

# Dumping LSA secrets: a story about task decorrelation

Краткое содержание: 

<blockquote>
To do so, you can use one of the many tools out there, for example NetExec:   ...   <br>This EDR was able to block me remotely (which is not surprising), but it also prevented me from dumping the LSA secrets locally using the usual reg save commands:   ...   <br>We have the values we are looking for, but if you pass these files to secretsdump, it will crash:   ...   <br>The reason is that secretsdump is expecting a specific file format which you will only get via reg save, a file format that contains the keys and a lot of metadata that reg export results doesn’t provide.   ...   <br>If I have got the reg export results in a text format, I can just import them in a Windows VM I own then reg save them and run secretsdump.   ...   <br>Which means I was able to dump the hives via reg save as well:   ...   <br>This boot key will then be used to decrypt things stored in the SAM and SECURITY hives which means that we need to get this key.   ...   <br>Looking at the reg export results we can see that we indeed have the keys:   ...   <br>The computed boot key (whether it is via the print technique or using the binary) The reg export results that we imported into our Windows VM and dumped as reg save results   ...   <br>Which means we have all we need to decrypt LSA secrets and SAM.   ...   <br>Get the boot key (whether running the previously mentioned binary whose only purpose is to query some registry key class values or via the print method) Reg export the SAM and SECURITY hives which you can you do using reg.exe.   ...   <br>If you do that, you will get all the information needed to decrypt the secrets, but since you have done minimalistic operations on the system, EDRs won’t see you.   ...

# Teaching the Old .NET Remoting New Exploitation Tricks

Авторы: 


Ссылка на контент: 
https://code-white.com/blog/teaching-the-old-net-remoting-new-exploitation-tricks/

Краткое содержание: 

<blockquote>
The example remoting server of log4net uses the RemoteLoggingServerPlugin to create an instance of the RemoteLoggingSinkImpl and marshal it for remoting:   ...   <br>The check for that is implemented in StackBuilderSink.VerifyIsOkToCallMethod(object, IMethodMessage) that verifies that only methods of the registered server type can be called:   ...   <br>In case of log4net, RemoteLoggingSinkImpl is explicitly marshaled as the interface IRemoteLoggingSink that only has one single method with return type void:   ...   <br>the parameter type is not primitive, an array type, or of type object, and a method on the passed argument (i.e., the ObjRef) is invoked.   ...   <br>James Forshaw has already demonstrated in Bypassing Low Type Filter in .NET Remoting back in 2019 that IsRemoting can be spoofed by using a custom marshaler for MethodCall during serialization, which is implemented by MethodCallWrapper in ExploitRemotingService.   ...   <br>server object is not marshaled as MarshalByRefObject TypeFilterLevel.Low in use (default) no existing client channel sink (and due to TypeFilterLevel.Low no permission to create one)   ...   <br>If we can call such methods, we are granted these permissions.   ...   <br>So, we create a custom marshaler for SoundPlayer so that it gets serialized by value instead of by reference, store it in the DataStore of the LogicalCallContext, send a dummy method call to the server:   ...   <br>Then we can obtain the SoundPlayer back from the LogicalCallContext of the received IMethodReturn (which is now a RemotingProxy to the remote SoundPlayer instance), and then call the setter of SoundLocation on it remotely:   ...   <br>We cannot access the current MethodCall, cannot create a RemotingSurrogateSelector/RemoteSurrogate and cannot make a .NET Remoting call (CAS restrictions).   ...   <br>Well, we can use XAML to create an Exception on the server, store the created WebClient in Exception.Data, and throw that exception using ExceptionDispatchInfo.Capture(Exception):   ...   <br>MarshalByRefObject marshalByRefObject = new WebClient();   ...   <br>exceptionData.Add("MBRO", new object[] { marshalByRefObject });   ...   <br>Then we obtain it on the client side back from IMethodReturn.Exception (which is now a RemotingProxy to the remote WebClient), and can then call any method on it remotely:   ...   <br>Even though CAS restrictions are in effect, the capabilities during deserialization are enough to create MarshalByRefObject objects such as a WebClient.   ...
