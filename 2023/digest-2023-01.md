In this intrusion, a malicious ISO file was delivered to a user which contained Ursnif malware.   ...   <br>They targeted a domain controller and used Impacket’s wmiexec.py to execute code on the remote host.   ...   <br>After connecting to the Cobalt Strike beacon on the domain controller, the threat actor executed another round of discovery tasks and dumped lsass memory on the domain controller.   ...   <br>In this case, the user had saved the file 3488164.iso to the their downloads folder and mounted it.   ...   <br>The contents of hidden folder “me”, included several files and folders that were used for the execution of Ursnif.   ...   <br>Ursnif Malware   ...   <br>Once the foothold had been achieved, after execution of Ursnif on the beachhead host, persistence was achieved by creating a ‘Run’ key named ManagerText which was configured to execute a LNK file which executed a PowerShell script.   ...   <br>Once the threat actor had Cobalt Strike running on the beachhead host, they ran the following commands:   ...   <br>The threat actor also used a batch script to collect a list of all computer objects on the domain using C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /C adcomp.bat which contained the PowerShell command:   ...   <br>The 127.0.01 and ADMIN$ indicates C:\Windows.   ...   <br>Correlating the network activity to the host activity confirms that the ‘Powershell.exe’ process initiated the WMI requests.   ...   <br>RDP was also used by the threat actor on the final two days of the intrusion to connect to various hosts from a domain controller proxying the traffic via the firefox.exe Cobalt Strike beacon.   ...   <br>The following Cobalt Strike C2 server was observed:   ...   <br>The following Cobalt Strike configuration was observed:   ...   <br>Checking the certificate used, reveals that it is a default SSL certificate for Cobalt Strike, 83cd09b0f73c909bfc14883163a649e1d207df22.   ...   <br>In this example, the mix of activity can be observed as:   ...   <br>The threat actor was able to RDP to a backup server using the admin credentials they acquired.   ...

# ShareFinder: How Threat Actors Discover File Shares

Краткое содержание: 

<blockquote>
For this reason, it is important for defenders to be able to detect and proactively hunt for signs of any unauthorized network share discovery in order to mitigate the impacts of data exfiltration and anything that may follow it, such as ransomware.   ...   <br>In this report, we’ll be profiling a commonly used tool for discovering shares in a network, the PowerShell script Invoke-ShareFinder, which we will call ShareFinder throughout the report.   ...   <br>There are multiple characteristics that can be extracted from this in order to be able to detect the presence of this network share scanning activity:   ...   <br>When conducting such an analysis, this may become an exercise to understand if the activity is normal for the host, or if one host connection to many other SMB hosts is not normal for the specific endpoint.   ...   <br>ICMP echo requests alone cannot be used as an indicator of file share discovery, this can also be a characteristic of network discovery software being used for legitimate or illegitimate purposes on the network.   ...   <br>ShareFinder supports the option of using a host file to scan only specific hosts on the network; however, if this option is not used, it will attempt to get a list of computers from the network via LDAP.   ...   <br>Using these logs we can then include a additional point of detection with the following rule, which could be helpful if a threat actor were to rename the functions in order to try to evade detection:   ...   <br>Just as with the network detection, the specific LDAP query used to get a list of all computer accounts in the Domain can be logged via Event ID 1644 in the Directory Service event source.   ...   <br>Event ID 1644 has the capability to log an entry for each LDAP search made against the Domain Controller, however, this can also produce a lot of noise and result in many unrelated logs.   ...   <br>It is important to mention, LDAP queries can be changed and will depend on the implementation of the script or software performing the query.   ...   <br>Just as with the network detection, network share access anomalies can also be found via network share auditing logs on the host.   ...   <br>In this case, we observe many similar traits as from the network detection:   ...   <br>From the ‘Source Address’ field in Event ID 5145 an investigator can determine the one-to-many relationship; however, once again, further analysis may be required to understand if the detected activity is normal for the environment and host.   ...   <br>An example of a detection using that logic can be found in the following sigma rule:   ...   <br>There are many tools that may overlap with the detection’s discussed in this article, for example, the Find-LocalAdmin script from PowerView has the capability to enumerate endpoints for local administrative privileges and has a similar one-to-many ICMP characteristic as described above.   ...

# Pause off my cluster: DERO cryptojacking takes a new shape

Авторы:

Краткое содержание: 

<blockquote>
In this incident, the threat actor abused anonymous access to an Internet-facing cluster to launch malicious container images hosted at Docker Hub, some of which have more than 10,000 pulls.   ...   <br>Interestingly, the threat actor has hard-coded their wallet and pool information into the miner executable, which enables the threat actor to execute the miner without any flags, probably as a defense evasion mechanism.   ...   <br>The early stages of this campaign were documented in March of 2023, but our latest findings show that this threat actor has been working to adapt their techniques in response to this publication.   ...   <br>For example, a K8s deployment named k8s-device-plugin in the kube-public namespace with pods containing an image called nohuppo:pause.   ...   <br>Another example is a daemonset named pytorch-container in the kube-system namespace with pods containing an image called dockerproxies/pause.   ...   <br>Overall, we observed five different deployments scattered across namespaces (the full list of the workloads and containers can be found in the Indicators of Compromise section at the end of this post).   ...   <br>The malicious docker images contain a miner named "pause" [T1036.005] which is located under /var/tmp or /usr/local/bin.   ...   <br>The name of this container is likely intended to mimic that of the real “pause” container [T1036.005] [T1610] commonly found in Kubernetes clusters.   ...   <br>The legitimate pause container runs a minimal binary named “pause”.   ...   <br>This is not the first-time attackers have chosen to mimic the “pause” container to hide malicious activity.   ...   <br>For example, in September 2020 Microsoft documented TeamTNT using Docker Hub images named “pause” [T1036.005] [T1610] to facilitate cryptojacking [T1496] (check out this blog to learn more about how threat actors can leverage several types of Kubernetes containers and pods).   ...   <br>However, in other variants, in addition to encrypted wallets, code was also added to hide additional mining pools:   ...   <br>This sample hardcodes the same wallet seen in the “pause” Linux samples observed in this incident (dero1qyy8xjrdjcn2dvr6pwe40jrl3evv9vam6tpx537vux60xxkx6hs7zqgde993y).   ...   <br>]link on May 7th, 2023.   ...   <br>Wiz customers can use the following controls to detect instances in their environment of the toxic risk combinations exploited by the attackers as an initial access vector:   ...   <br>Wiz customers can use the Wiz Sensor and Threat Detection Rules to be alerted of actions performed in their environment that could relate to the aforementioned attack.   ...   <br>Kubernetes audit log–based rules detect initial actions by anonymous users.   ...

We have identified a threat actor targeting publicly exposed instances of Selenium Grid and leveraging features of Selenium WebDriver API to run Python with a reverse shell to deploy scripts that download a XMRig miner.   ...   <br>The threat actor has leveraged Selenium WebDriver API's features to run Python with a reverse shell to deploy scripts that download the miner.   ...   <br>In this blog, we will explain how threat actors can exploit exposed Selenium Grid services, detail the post-exploitation payload used by the attacker, and provide best practices for using Selenium.   ...   <br>A node can be any machine registered to the hub and capable of running a browser instance.   ...   <br>Selenium Grid is not designed to be exposed to the internet and its default configuration has no authentication enabled, so any user that has network access to the hub can interact with the nodes via API.   ...   <br>Although the Selenium website includes this warning about exposing Selenium Grid to the internet, it is evident that users often overlook this warning and deploy Selenium Grid without adequate network security controls.   ...   <br>In the malicious activity described in this blogpost, we witnessed the threat actor utilizing older versions of Selenium (v3.141.59) to run remote commands.   ...   <br>Exposed Selenium Grid services running v3.141.59   ...   <br>Threat actors can abuse this feature to set the location of Chrome binary on the machine to be the path of any other binary, such as Python.   ...   <br>This means that instead of Chrome binary, the WebDriver will execute a Python interpreter process.   ...   <br>It is important to note that although the capability to set the Chrome binary location path was deprecated in later versions, we confirmed that the latest version of Selenium Grid is also vulnerable to remote command execution if exposed to the internet.   ...   <br>In the activity we observed, the threat actor sends a request to the vulnerable Selenium Grid hub, with Chrome binary path configured to /usr/bin/python3 and add argument set to pass Python program as a script.   ...   <br>By default, the seluser, which is the Selenium process user, can run sudo commands without requiring a password.   ...   <br>]90.149.104, we believe this IP belongs to a legitimate service that has been compromised by the threat actor [T1584.004], as it also hosts a publicly exposed Selenium Grid instance.   ...   <br>We suspect the pool address is a legitimate IP that has been compromised and is being used as a mining pool proxy service since this IP also hosts Selenium Grid.   ...   <br>Any version of the Selenium Grid service that lacks proper authentication and network security policies is vulnerable to remote command execution.   ...   <br>The Wiz Dynamic Scanner detects publicly exposed Selenium services within customers' cloud environments.   ...   <br>Here is an example of the Wiz Runtime Sensor detecting a reverse shell used in a Selenium Grid exploit:   ...   <br>We identified an active cryptomining campaign targeting older versions of Selenium Grid services that are exposed to the internet.   ...

Our research into SAP AI Core began through executing legitimate AI training procedures using SAP’s infrastructure.   ...   <br>The Wiz Research Team uncovered serious vulnerabilities in SAP AI Core, revealing potential risks in #AI infrastructure.   ...   <br>SAP AI Core is a service that allows users to develop, train and run AI services in a scalable and managed way, utilizing SAP’s vast cloud resources.   ...   <br>However, SAP’s admission controller blocked all the dangerous security options we tried – for example, running our container as root.   ...   <br>Since our sidecar was the Istio proxy, we gained access to Istio’s configuration, including an access token to the cluster’s centralized Istiod server.   ...   <br>Since Istio itself is excluded from Istio’s iptables rules – we were now running without any traffic restrictions!   ...   <br>Using our Istio token, we were able to read configurations from the Istiod server and gain insight on the internal environment – which led us to the following findings.   ...   <br>A common problem with EFS instances is their default configuration as public – meaning credentials aren’t needed to view or edit files, as long as you have network access to their NFS ports.   ...   <br>Querying this server on our internal network revealed highly privileged secrets to SAP’s Docker Registry as well as its Artifactory server:   ...   <br>Read more Bug #5: Unauthenticated Helm server compromises K8s cluster, exposing Google access tokens and customer secrets   ...   <br>Furthermore, this access level would have allowed us to view customers’ own secrets – even secrets that are beyond the scope of SAP AI Core.   ...   <br>In line with our previous Kubernetes-related vulnerabilities, this research also demonstrates the tenant isolation pitfalls of using K8s in managed services.   ...   <br>Jan. 25, 2024 – Wiz Research reports security findings to SAP   ...

# Probllama: Ollama Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2024-37032) – Overview and Mitigations

Краткое содержание: 

<blockquote>
Our research indicates that, as of June 10, there are a large number of Ollama instances running a vulnerable version that are exposed to the internet.   ...   <br>Our research team makes an active effort to contribute to the security of AI services, tooling, and infrastructure, and we also use AI in our research work.   ...   <br>The client is what the user interacts with (i.e. the front-end), which could be, for example, a CLI (command-line interface).   ...   <br>While experimenting with Ollama, our team found a critical security vulnerability in an Ollama server.   ...   <br>This issue is extremely severe in Docker installations, as the server runs with root privileges and listens on 0.0.0.0 by default – which enables remote exploitation of this vulnerability.   ...   <br>By default, models are downloaded from Ollama’s official registry (registry.ollama.com), however, it is also possible to fetch models from private registries.   ...   <br>What we found is that when pulling a model from a private registry (by querying the http://[victim]:11434/api/pull API endpoint), it is possible to supply a malicious manifest file that contains a path traversal payload in the digest field.   ...   <br>This issue can be exploited to corrupt arbitrary files on the system.   ...   <br>We found out that if our model’s manifest contains a traversal payload for the digest of one of its layers, when attempting to push this model to a remote registry via the http://[victim]:11434/api/push endpoint, the server will leak the content of the file specified in the digest field.   ...   <br>We responsibly disclosed this vulnerability to Ollama’s development team in May 2024.   ...   <br>May 5, 2024 – Wiz Research reported the issue to Ollama.   ...
